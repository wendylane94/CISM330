	<p>Get to know me! My name is Wendy Lane. I am kind of an odd one. I started in education, but worked in our business office at my university and absolutely fell in love with higher ed. Since finishing my education degree, I built a career combining the two in that I train and oversee a team in higher ed in new system setup, new processes, help with problem solving, and over all workflows, management, and day to day of the team. I have been blessed to continue learning and growing and pursuing IT with a focus in Network Administration and have learned so much to use in my current role and to take with me in any future opportunities I am blessed with.</p>
